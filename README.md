# 💸 Expense Planner

A personal finance tracker Android app that helps users **plan budgets**, **track transactions**, and **visualize expenses** through **interactive charts**. Built with Firebase and MPAndroidChart for real-time and insightful financial management.
The is not configured properly currently and so it doesn't look visually good on all android devices. I may update the layout or rework the front end later on.
